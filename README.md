# Cryptobot

Cryptobot is a set of webhooks that communicate directly with Facebook messsenger service and allow user to seach for historic 14 day price information for cryptocurrencies leveraging Coingecko API

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

You need the env vars from the repo admin to connect to the chatbot

Deployment

  * Deployment is using gigalixir (build config is held in *buildpack_* flles)
  * You need to be added to the project on gigalixir with your user account
  * Simply push the latest changes to master and use `git push gigalixir` to deploy the latest version
